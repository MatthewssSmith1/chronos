# Chronos Calendar Component Architecture

## Overview
A composable, shadcn-compatible calendar solution that provides functionality similar to Google Calendar. The system will be built with flexibility and reusability in mind, allowing for various display modes and easy integration into different layouts.

## Core Components

### CalendarProvider
- Central state management using React Context
- Manages:
  - Current view type (day/week/month/year/schedule)
  - Selected date range
  - Selected categories/calendars
  - Events data
  - View-specific settings
- Exposes methods for:
  - Navigation (next/previous period)
  - View switching
  - Category filtering
  - Event CRUD operations

### TopBar
- ViewSelector (Popover)
  - Day view
  - Week view
  - Month view
  - Year view
  - Schedule/List view
- Navigation Controls
  - Previous/Next buttons
  - Today button
  - Date display/picker
- CategoryFilter (Popover)
  - Multi-select calendar/category interface
  - Color indicators
  - Toggle all/none
- Time Zone Selector (Popover)

### MainContent
- DayView
  - Hour-by-hour grid
  - Event blocks with drag-and-drop
- WeekView
  - Similar to day view but with columns for each day
  - Week header with dates
- MonthView
  - Traditional calendar grid
  - Event previews with overflow handling
- YearView
  - Month grid overview
  - Heat map or event indicators
- ScheduleView
  - Chronological list of upcoming events
  - Grouping by day/week
  - Infinite scroll or pagination

### CategorySelector
- Standalone component for sidebar integration
- Same functionality as CategoryFilter popover
- Syncs with CalendarProvider state
- Can be used independently or within TopBar

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Implement optimized re-rendering strategies

### Styling
- Leverage shadcn/ui components and styling conventions wherever possible (theme variables)
- Tailwind CSS v4 for responsive design
- CSS Grid for calendar layouts

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management

### Event Handling
- Drag and drop support
- Resize events
- Multi-day events
- Recurring events
- Event overlap handling

## Implementation Phases

1. Core Infrastructure
   - Set up CalendarProvider
   - Implement basic state management
   - Create base layout components

2. View Components
   - Implement each view type
   - Ensure consistent styling
   - Add navigation controls

3. Event Management
   - Event rendering
   - CRUD operations
   - Drag and drop

4. Category System
   - Category management
   - Filtering implementation
   - Color system

5. Advanced Features
   - Recurring events
   - Export/import
   - Search functionality
   - Keyboard shortcuts

## Integration Example

```tsx
